          <h1>Introduction</h1>
        </div>

        <div class="sectionContent">
          <p>
            In my experience, two personalities pervade most cooperative efforts: <i>owners</i> and <i>employees</i>.
            I am an owner.
            I can’t help it.
            It’s in my DNA.
          </p>

          <p>
            At my core, I am a product engineer.
            I’ve been coding since junior high.
            But building software to meet a diverse set of (sometimes mutually exclusive) customer needs is what I love.
          </p>

          <p>
            I am innately curious and instinctively strive for deep understanding.
            If one finds me lying awake at night, or zoning out in the shower, it’s most likely because I am immersed in a difficult puzzle.
            I am partial to Greenleaf’s ideas on “servant leadership” and Covey’s deconstruction of trust.
            I’m also aware of the vigilance required to realize those ideas in the workplace.
          </p>

          <p>
            As a licensed patent attorney, I can also help identify and file patents for the technologies I help invent and build.
            I can also hire, mentor, and assist with licensing and other deal-making.
